# AI Agent Instructions

## CRITICAL: Read First

Before making ANY changes, read: `ARCHITECTURE.md`

This file contains:
- What NOT to touch (production code that works)
- Safe operations guide
- System architecture
- Troubleshooting

## Quick Rules

1. ✅ Add new features as separate modules
2. ❌ Don't modify working production code
3. ✅ Follow existing patterns
4. ❌ Don't refactor "to improve" - if it works, leave it
5. ✅ Test thoroughly before deploying

## Working Production Files (DO NOT MODIFY)

- `src/scripts/fetch_production_data.py`
- `src/agent_runtime/market_intel_agent.py`
- `src/agent_runtime/tools/market_analysis_tools.py`
- `src/agent_runtime/tools/news_analysis_tools.py`
- `src/web/components/market/AIInsights.tsx`

## Documentation Hierarchy

1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Read this first
2. `docs/MARKET_INTELLIGENCE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide
3. `README.md` - Quick reference

## When User Asks to "Improve"

1. Check if it's working - if yes, suggest additions instead
2. Ask WHY they want changes
3. Propose new features alongside existing code
4. Never break what works

Remember: The best code is code that doesn't need to be written.
